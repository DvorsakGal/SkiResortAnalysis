# ⛷️ Ski Resort Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes ski resorts using classification and regression techniques. The goal is to predict the **quality of a ski resort** (classification) and the **price of an adult day ticket** (regression). The dataset includes **1561 instances** and **19 features**.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of the following features:

- **Name_resort**: Ski resort name
- **Rate**: Rating
- **Km_Freeride**: Kilometers of marked freeride trails
- **Continent**: Continent of the resort
- **Country**: Country of the resort
- **Altitude**: Elevation in meters
- **Easy**: Kilometers of easy slopes
- **Intermediate**: Kilometers of intermediate slopes
- **Difficult**: Kilometers of difficult slopes
- **Adult**: Price of an adult day ticket
- **Currency**: Currency of the ticket price
- **Size**: Resort size category
- **Slope_offering**: Type of slope offerings
- **Lifts**: Number of ski lifts
- **Apres-ski**: Availability of après-ski activities
- **Snow_parks**: Availability of snow parks
- **Cross_country**: Availability of cross-country ski trails
- **Latitude & Longitude**: Resort geographical coordinates
- **Total_KMs**: Total slope kilometers
- **Resort_Quality**: Categorized as Excellent, Good, or Bad

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 🐍**
- **Pandas 📊** for data manipulation
- **Seaborn 🎨** for data visualization
- **NumPy 🔢** for numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn 🤖** for machine learning models
